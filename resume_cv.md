#### Applied Cognitive Scientist

May 2024-Present

- Delivered two **Generative AI** applications from concept to functional prototype: 
  - A flexible form-builder that enabled non-technical form authors to define form field validation logic.
  - A legal decision-support tool leveraging retrieval augmented generation (**RAG**) to query relevant documents and ensure user compliance with context relevant laws. 
  
  These prototypes demonstrated the feasibility of **AI-powered decision support tools** in resource constrained operational environments.

- Designed evaluation frameworks and **benchmarking protocols** that measured the **real-world utility**, accuracy, and **alignment** performance of open-source large language models (**LLMs**) in form completion and legal analysis.

- Collected domain specific data through structured interviews with subject matter experts and used insights to build synthetic data generation pipelines that supported model benchmarking.

- Incorporated principles from **human-AI interaction** and cognitive science into **product design** to **improve usability** and **reduced cognitive load** for end users in operational contexts.

#### Graduate Student Researcher

July 2018-June 2024

- Applied **ML** and **signal processing** techniques to EEG recorded during a spatial memory task and quantify how aerobic exercise alters the fidelity of neural representations in **working memory**, which resulted in a **first-author publication** that has accumulated **11 citations** to-date.

- Developed a **logistic regression** model to decode the **perception** of semantic congruency between word and object pairs from augmented reality (AR) evoked EEG activity, demonstrating the feasibility of an **AR-BCI** that can provide near **real-time feedback** on semantic recognition tasks. Findings were published in a high-impact journal. 

- Led the construction of a **Bayesian hierarchical regression** model to synthesize over **600** effect sizes from studies testing exercise-induced changes in cognition, and produced a **first-author publication** that highlighted the small but reliable enhancements in task performance (**28 citations** to-date).

- Evaluated 7 **time series forecasting** models (VARIMA, RNN, TCN, S6, Transformers, and Dynamic Mode Decomposition) on forecasting task-related EEG. The comparison showed that RNNs produced the best short term and long term forecasts of multivariate EEG activity.

- Built **PyTorch** classification models that predicted **basketball free throw accuracy** from neural time series for more than **300 shots** collected from recreational and **NCAA athletes**. This work demonstrated the feasibility of predicting real-world motor performance from brain activity.

- Co-authored a **book chapter** detailing the physiological basis of EEG, time-frequency analysis methods, and recent advancements in the use of ML to decode aspects of cognition.

#### Research Scientist

June 2022-December 2023

- Contributed to DARPA’s Enabling Confidence program to **advance explainable AI** using dynamical systems modeling to estimate confidence intervals of ML outputs.

- Created **forecasting pipelines** for COVID-19 transmission using autoregressive models with **Bayesian hyperparameter tuning** across all U.S. states.

- Developed a collision avoidance system that combined a CNN and RNN to forecast multimodal time series data

- Applied ideas from Koopman operator theory to analyze the spectral properties of neural network weight dynamics during training, which supported work on model interpretability and stability analysis.
