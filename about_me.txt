Hello, my name is Jordan Garrett! As a <b>Research Scientist</b> working at the intersection of <b>Cognitive Neuroscience</b>, <b>AI/ML</b>, and <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>, I apply insights across these disciplines to engineer intelligent systems that augment human cognition. My mission is to maximize the performance of human-AI teams. I achieve this by implementing cutting-edge statical algorithms and developing intuitive user interfaces that transform complex data streams into actionable insights, ensuring that both artificial agents and humans remain resilient and effective in high-stakes environments.
