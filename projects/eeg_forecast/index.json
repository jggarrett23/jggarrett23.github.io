Briefly, this data was recorded using a 64 channel EEG cap while human subjects viewed visual stimuli on a computerized screen. Importantly, these stimuli were flickered at a rate between 1-60 Hz at increments of 1 Hz for five seconds to induce a steady state visual evoked response (SSEVP). SSEVPs are characterized by oscillations at the exact same frequency as the displayed visual stimulus, and are commonly used as input signals for brain computer-interfaces due to their high signal-to-noise ratio.","position":{"start":{"line":32,"column":1},"end":{"line":32,"column":1}},"key":"h5NAOLxfRo"}],"key":"ujpFOyfHgZ"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":1},"end":{"line":34,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lets get started!","position":{"start":{"line":34,"column":1},"end":{"line":34,"column":1}},"key":"KrSiAZWqPu"}],"key":"sI1iXGgIUe"}],"key":"ff51TZHGXC"}],"key":"wjNGNHW2gx"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"next":{"title":"Vector Autoregression Integrated Moving Average Model (VARIMA)","short_title":"Vector Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average","url":"/varima","group":"Forecasting EEG"}}},"domain":"http://localhost:3004"}
