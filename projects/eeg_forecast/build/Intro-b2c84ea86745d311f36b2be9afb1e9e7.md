# Introduction: Forecasting the Future Brain States

Time-series forecasting is a pillar of modern data science, spanning economics, meteorology, and neuroscience. The goal is simple yet ambitious: to predict the future state of a system based on historical observations and underlying dynamics.

We generally categorize forecasting approaches into two distinct schools:

1. Traditional Statistical Methods: These models decompose a series into trends, seasonality, and cycles. They are highly interpretable but rely on strict assumptions:

    - Stationarity: The statistical properties (mean, variance) remain constant over time. (Note: Non-stationarity is actually when these change).

    - Linearity: The assumption of a linear relationship between past and future states.

    - Independence: Model residuals must be uncorrelated.

2. Machine & Deep Learning (DL) Methods: DL models, such as Transformers or GRUs, are "universal function approximators." They excel at capturing complex, non-linear mappings without requiring the data to satisfy rigid statistical assumptions. Recent strides in sequence-to-sequence modeling have made DL highly competitive for both short-term and long-term horizons.

## EEG 

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive method for measuring electrical potentials generated by synchronous post-synaptic neural activity. A hallmark of this neuroimaging method is that it has exceptional temporal resolution that enables the near real-time recording of cortical activity underlying cognition and behavior. EEG research has provided seminal insights into a wide variety of brain functions, including the processing of environmental stimuli and their internal representations, the execution of different motor movements, and the occurrence of abnormal neural activity (e.g., seizures). Although substantial work has been dedicated towards understanding the state of the brain *in the moment*, relatively little has focused on determining how this state will evolve *in the future*. 

## Forecasting Algorithms & Data

In the following sections, we will cover the theoretical background and application of the following forecasting algorithms: 

- Vector Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (VARIMA)
- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
- Temporal Convolution Network (TCN)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Transformer
- Selective State Space Model (S6)

For our analyses, we will use an open-source dataset from [Gu et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03023-7). Briefly, this data was recorded using a 64 channel EEG cap while human subjects viewed visual stimuli on a computerized screen. Importantly, these stimuli were flickered at a rate between 1-60 Hz at increments of 1 Hz for five seconds to induce a steady state visual evoked response (SSEVP). SSEVPs are characterized by oscillations at the exact same frequency as the displayed visual stimulus, and are commonly used as input signals for brain computer-interfaces due to their high signal-to-noise ratio.
