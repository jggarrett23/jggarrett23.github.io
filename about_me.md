# About Me

Hello, my name is Jordan Garrett! As a **Research Scientist** working at the intersection of **Cognitive Neuroscience**, **AI/ML**, and **Human-Computer Interaction**, I apply insights across these disciplines to engineer intelligent systems that augment human cognition. My mission is to maximize the performance of human-AI teams. I strive to accomplish this goal by implementing **cutting-edge statical algorithms** and developing **intuitive user interfaces**. My work transforms complex data streams into **actionable insights** that ensures artificial agents are resilient and aligned with human goals, ultimately facilitating effective human decision-making in high-stakes environments.  

My technical skills include **experimental design**, constructing end-to-end **data analysis** pipelines, **data visualization**, **machine learning**, and **web application development**. My soft skills include conducting interviews with subject matter experts, identifying opportunities for **AI integration** in user workflows, translating analyses into intuitive **interface design patterns**, and **communicating complex model outputs** to **non-technical stakeholders** through presentations and write-ups.
